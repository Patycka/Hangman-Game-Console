# Hangman-Game-Console

The goal of the project is to write console hangman game.
The program randomly draws a word from some set of english words and
next shows the template in the form  _ _ _ _ _ where each underscore
corresponds to an unknown letter. A player guesses one letter each time from
the set of not yet used letters. The player wins when guesses the whole word and
losses when the maximum number of mistakes (lifes) is reached.
